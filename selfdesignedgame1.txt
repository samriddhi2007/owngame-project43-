TITLE OF THE PROJECT :
 "ANIMAL KINGDOM"

GOAL OF THE PROJECT :
THE GOAL OF MY PROJECT IS TO CREATE A GAME FOR CHILDREN TO UNDERSTAND THE SOUNDS WHICH SOME COMMON ANIMALS MAKE.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF MY STORY :
NOWDAYS, AS EVERYTHING HAS GONE ONLINE, I HAVE THOUGHT TO CREATE A GAME FOR VERY YOUNG KIDS TO KNOW THE SOUNDS MADE BY SOME COMMON ANIMALS. IT WILL BE 
HELPFUL FOR THEM TO RECOGNIZE THE ANIMAL AND THE SOUND IT MAKES. IT WILL BE AN INFORMATIVE AND A FUN EXPERIENCE FOR THE KIDS.

THE PLAYING CHARACTERS IN MY GAME:
1. ELEPHANT
2. MONKEY
3. DOG
4. CAT
5. LION
6. TIGER
7. PARROT
8. MOUSE
9. COW
10. HORSE

THE NON-PLAYING CHARACTERS:
NONE


HOW DO YOU PLAN TO MAKE YOUR GAME ENGAGING?
I WILL ADD IMAGES OF THE ANIMALS NEXT TO THE BUTTONS. WHENEVER ANYONE WILL CLICK ON THE BUTTON, THE RESPECTIVE SOUND WHICH THE ANIMAL MAKES WILL COME OUT FOR 
ABOUT 10 SECONDS. AND THERE WILL BE A TEXT "GOOD PETS" IN WHICH ALL THE FARM ANIMALS WILL BE THERE. AND THERE WILL BE ONE TEXT "BAD ANIMALS" IN WHICH THERE
WILL BE ALL THE WILD ANIMALS. SO THROUGH THIS, THEY CAN DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE FARMA ND THE WILD ANIMALS.
